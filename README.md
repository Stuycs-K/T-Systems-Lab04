# Lab04

# Functionality Requirement:

int sieve(int n); // this is the only required function 

# Makefile:

I will not run your makefile, but you should use one to validate your function.

# Suggested Workflow:

```
int sieve(int n){
   return sieveV2(n);//call your fastest working one here
}

//basic version
int sieveV1(int n){
  //code that is tested and working
}

//stopped early when checking primes
int sieveV2(int n){
  //code that is tested and working
}

//added extra something...
int sieveV2(int n){
  //code that is NOT tested yet
}
```
